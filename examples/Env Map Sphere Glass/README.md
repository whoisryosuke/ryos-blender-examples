# Environment Height Map Displaced Sphere

This is an example of using an environment height map (the topology of a mountain in black and white) combined with the Displace modifier to quickly create crystal rock like formations.

The object features a glass material made by mixing a few Refraction BSDF with a Glass BSDF. All of them have custom normals to create a more "rough" surface.
